          </p>
          <p class="blogHeading fw-bold">
            That longing for someone to love and feel loved by someone was an all-too-familiar feeling for me. </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph">
            I recall calling up one of my friends one night in tears and sharing with her the frustration I felt with
            dating, my unsuccessful experience with dating apps, and the sadness I felt because I was single. </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph">
            Her response to me still echos my mind: “Being single is hard”.
          </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph">
            That response felt like a game changer to me. I suddenly felt a softness in my body. I realized this whole
            time I wasn't accepting the fact that I was single. Hearing her validate my feelings was just what I needed
            to realize that being single doesn't have to feel so shitty. I began to wonder why I was measuring my
            self-worth on the fact that I wasn’t in a romantic relationship. And then it hit me: I wasn't in a loving
            relationship with myself.
          </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph">
            I was looking for something (or someone, in this case) outside of myself to validate my self-worth. At that
            moment I realized I would do whatever it took to stop giving my power away and made a vow to create a more
            loving relationship with myself. Over time, I learned different strategies that really helped nurture the
            relationship I have with myself.
          </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph">
            Here’s how I did it...
          </p>

          <p class="blogParagraph fw-bold">
            1. Talk to yourself in the way you would want a partner to talk to you.
          </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph">
            I still do this to this day. I find it most effective talking to myself in front of a mirror. You can look
            in the mirror, stare deeply into your eyes and say out loud (or in your mind): “I love you, I really love
            you. I am so proud of you. You are so beautiful. You are perfect exactly as you are. You are enough.” Notice
            any resistance you might feel in your body as you say these words. It might help to soften your statements
            with "I am willing to love you. I am willing to believe you are enough,” etc.
          </p>

          <p class="blogParagraph fw-bold">
            2. Take yourself on a date!
          </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph">
            Here’s how I did it...
          </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph fw-bold">
            3. Make time to be physically intimate with yourself.
          </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph">
            It's really important to get in touch with your body and allow yourself to indulge in all of your senses.
            I've found setting time aside to be intimate with myself through the use of aromatherapy oils and massaging
            lotions really help me foster a loving relationship with myself.
          </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph fw-bold">
            4. Buy yourself something to symbolize your commitment to working on your relationship with yourself. </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph">
            A good friend of mine did this and gave me this amazing idea. She bought a ring for herself and wore it
            every day as a reminder of her commitment to herself! She said she made a vow that day to marry herself and
            make herself her top priority.
          </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph fw-bold">
            5. Call a friend and voice/share your feelings.
          </p>
          <p class="blogParagraph mb-5">
            Hearing someone listen and validate how I was feeling was what I needed to remind myself that I wasn't alone
            and that it was okay to feel how I was feeling. Sometimes just knowing that you're not alone on your journey
            can make you feel safe and build trust in yourself to move forward with an open heart!
